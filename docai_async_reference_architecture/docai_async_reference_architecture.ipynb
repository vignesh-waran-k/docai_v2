    "# Overview of Document AI Toolkit - Asynchronous\n",
    "The objective is to develop a document ai toolkit but this time instead of “Synchronous API” , **Asynchronous API** must be used  to increase the capabilities of the original document ai toolkit. This tool should be capable of ingesting a number of documents,  batching the documents in the count of 50s, processing and providing the status for monitoring. This solution is packaged and made available to you. You  also can take advantage of automated deployment without having to set up their environment and create each of the services which are utilized in this approach."

    "* **Documentation Ingestion & Services Initialization**: In this step, you are expected to run an initializer script that orchestrates required GCP services - Storage bucket, DocAI, Cloud Functions, Scheduler and Firestore. Also in this step,your  files are  input to the Cloud storage bucket for processing further. This is achieved by shell script which ensures the environment is set up automatically.\n",
    "    * **Cloud Shell** : You need to run the provided shell script. This eliminates workarounds like manual setup of each service involved for this activity.\n",
    "    * **Cloud Storage**: This is storage bucket where your  files are landed\n",
    "* **Scheduled Async batch processing** : Processing (async batching) happens in this step. The Cloud Functions are triggered to perform the processing of the landed files from the Storage bucket of the previous step. Here, the files are grouped in batches of 50 and get processed concurrently. Next step is logging the activity and storing the data for visualization. The scheduler aids in automation of repeated workflow of this entire process i.e., from files ingestion to processing to logging.\n",
    "    * **Cloud Functions gen2** : This service helps in running the python script where the core async batch processing logic is implemented.\n",
    "    * **Cloud Storage** : a temporary directory is created to track every processing activity.\n",
    "    * **Cloud scheduler** : Ensures the cloud functions are triggered automatically every hour.\n",
    "* **Logging and Visualization**: With the help of a firestore database, datapoints such as status, output path, operation id, timestamps are logged for every run. Data visualization can also be provided for the insights. \n",
    "    * **Firestore Database**: This is a document database that stores key:value pairs. Data about each run logged in this database for  this context.\n",
